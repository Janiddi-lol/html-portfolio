<h3>The Dark Knight Trilogy </h3>

<p>This is a set of three Christopher Nolan Batman movies. I like the capticating actions and scenes that has beeb produced in this trilogy. No mattaer how much times I do watch I always felt satisfied and gained the right motivation to move on the failures I have experineces before watching them.</p>
<p>The DC character, Batman, is my childhood hero to whom I always wanted to be. So the only movie that has been realitically portrayed the real DC character of Batman was Christian Bale which makes love these movies even more</p>
